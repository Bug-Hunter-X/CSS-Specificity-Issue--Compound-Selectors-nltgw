The solution involves a clearer understanding and application of CSS specificity.  Instead of relying on a compound selector that might be misinterpreted, it's better to use more precise selectors that reflect the intended hierarchy of styles:

```css
#container {
  width: 500px;
}

.container {
  width: 600px;
}

/* Corrected styling: Use a class for more precise styling if needed */
#container.special-container {
  width: 700px;
}
```

By using a separate class `special-container`, we can more clearly and accurately apply the `width: 700px` style only when the `container` element also requires that specific style.
