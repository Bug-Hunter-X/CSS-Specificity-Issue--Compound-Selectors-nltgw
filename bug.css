The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
#container {
  width: 500px;
}

.container {
  width: 600px;
}

#container.container {
  width: 700px;
}
```

The unexpected behavior stems from the use of a compound selector (`#container.container`). While seemingly straightforward, this selector's specificity can be easily misunderstood, causing unexpected overrides.

The intention might be to style a specific element with both the `id` `container` and the class `container`. However, due to CSS specificity rules, the `id` selector (`#container`) is more specific than the compound selector, hence the `width: 700px` rule is applied in this case.
